# Facemask-Detection
This Model detects the face of an individual with real time video streams and concludes whether an individual is wearing a mask or not.


Problem Statement : The main objective of Facemask Detection model is to detect the face of individual and conclude whether the individual is wearing a mask or not
                    at that particular moment when they are captured on the real time video stream
